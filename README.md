# WineRecommendationPrediction
Datasets:
1.	Clean_wine_dataset.csv
2.	winemag-data_first150k
3.	winemag-data-130k-v2

Note: Dataset #1 is consolidated and cleaned version of datasets 2 & 3. Use DMP Final Project Notebook – Data Cleaning & EDA.ipynb to create #1 from #2 & #3.


Python Notebooks:
1.	DMP Final Project Notebook – Data Cleaning & EDA.ipynb
2.	Wine_BERT_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb
3.	Price_Prediction_Classification_Analysis_. ipynb
4.	Point Prediction Regression Analysis.ipynb
5.	Recommendation_System_Final.ipynb

Note: Run notebook 1 first, then notebook 2. Notebooks 3-5 can be run in any order.

Summary:
1.	DMP Final Project Notebook – Data Cleaning & EDA.ipynb
•	Consolidate original winemag datasets
•	Clean and pre-process data for modeling
•	Execute exploratory data analysis on clean dataset
2.	Wine_BERT_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb
•	Categorize the wine points into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments
•	Used BERT model to predict the sentiment with a fine-tuning method
•	Used Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Voting Classifier to predict the sentiment
3.	Price_Prediction_Classification_Analysis_. Ipynb
•	Used to predict price classification 
4.	Point Prediction Regression Analysis.ipynb
•	Used to predict discrete points per bottle of wine 
5.	Recommendation Systems – Recommendation_System_Final.ipynb
•	1st  recommendation system: recommend wine titles based on input description 
•	2nd recommendation system: recommend grape varieties based on input variety
